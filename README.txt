DaMSA AisLib is a Java library for handling AIS messages. This include

 * Reading from AIS sources e.g. serial connection, TCP connection or file
 * Decoding sentences and AIS messages
 * Encoding sentences and AIS messages
 * Sending AIS messages #6, #8, #12 and #14
 * Handling application specific messages

The library contains test code and example applications.

The project is separated into three parts:
  main     - The main AIS library
  test     - Various JUnit test code
  examples - Example applications


Building
========

To build you will need

 * JDK 1.6+ (http://java.sun.com/j2se/)
 * Apache Ant 1.7+ (http://ant.apache.org)

To build everything
 
 ant
 
To run tests. All tests with filename *Test.java will be executed. 
Change build.xml to allow specific test targets.

 ant test

Make a distributable JAR file

 ant dist
 
To make Javadoc 

  ant javadoc
 

Examples
========

The examples source are placed under src/examples/java

To build all example applications use 

  ant 
  
or

  ant examples
  
The example applications are installed in examples/. Installation of the
example applications are controlled in build-examples.xml.

The dumper application can be started by first building and then going to
the examples/dumper and use either dumper.sh or dumper.bat on Linux and
Windows respectively.

  ant
  cd examples/dumper
  sh dumper.sh -t localhost:4001
  
The filter application can be started by first building and then going to
the examples/filter and use either filter.sh or filter.bat on Linux and
Windows respectively.

  ant
  cd examples/dumper
  sh dumper.sh -t localhost:4001
